# ⚠️ PUBLIC REPOSITORY RULES ⚠️

## READ THIS BEFORE ANY GIT OPERATION

This repository has a **PUBLIC GITHUB MIRROR** at github.com/neilofneils404/graftonhub

### WHAT IS ALLOWED IN PUBLIC COMMITS

✅ Source code (src/, public/)
✅ Package files (package.json, package-lock.json)
✅ Config files (astro.config.mjs, tsconfig.json)
✅ Public data (data/*.json)
✅ Basic README.md (simplified, no internal details)
✅ Simple CHANGELOG.md (version list only)

### WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN

❌ ANY file ending in `-internal.md`
❌ `.graftonhub-notes.md`
❌ MAINTENANCE.md, maintenance-log.md
❌ PROJECT-REFERENCE.md, future-ideas.md
❌ Any file in research/, notes/, internal/ directories
❌ Deployment troubleshooting details
❌ User feedback specifics
❌ Cron job IDs or maintenance schedules
❌ Cost tracking or sub-agent details
❌ "What happened on X date" narratives
❌ Infrastructure details beyond basics

### FILE NAMING CONVENTION

**Local-only files MUST end in `-internal.md`**
- DEPLOY-internal.md ✅
- CHANGELOG-internal.md ✅
- VERSION-internal.md ✅

If you create a new internal doc, name it `SOMETHING-internal.md` and it will auto-exclude.

### BEFORE EVERY COMMIT

1. Run: `git status` - Review what's staged
2. Run: `git diff --cached` - See actual changes
3. Check: No `-internal.md` files in the commit
4. Check: No detailed workflow/troubleshooting in commit message
5. THEN: Commit and push

### PRE-COMMIT HOOK

A git hook is installed in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that will BLOCK commits containing forbidden files.

If the hook blocks your commit, it means you tried to commit something that shouldn't be public.

**Remember:** Public repo = portfolio piece. Internal details stay local.
