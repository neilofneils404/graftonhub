Hi there,

Thank you so much for taking the time to share that feedback about Carlisle Township! You were absolutely right, and I really appreciate you helping make GraftonHub more accurate for our neighbors.

**Here's what I've updated:**

✅ **Electric:** Changed to **Lorain-Medina Rural Electric (LMRE)** as the primary provider for Carlisle Township, with Ohio Edison noted as an alternative for some areas. LMRE is confirmed via their official district map.

✅ **Wastewater:** Added **Avon Lake Regional Water** explicitly (via LORCO district) for connected areas. You're correct—ALRW provides the treatment for parts of Carlisle Township through the LORCO partnership.

**About the pharmacy:**

I did some research on Midview Drug, and while it's a great local option serving the Grafton area, it's actually about 6.2 miles from Carlisle Township center. Several pharmacies in Elyria (like Walgreens at 100 Cleveland St and CVS) are closer at around 4-5 miles. So I'd say Midview Drug is *one of the closest local options* but not necessarily *the* closest for most Carlisle residents—depends on which part of the township you're in!

**All changes are live now at graftonhub.com/utilities.**

Thanks again for helping keep this information accurate. If you notice anything else that needs updating, I'm always here: neil@neilofneils.com

Best,  
Neil
