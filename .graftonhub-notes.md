# GraftonHub Development Notes

## Feb 17, 2026 - Senior Resources Page Launch

**What shipped:**
- New `/seniors` page with comprehensive Lorain County resources
- Added to homepage quick-grid as "Senior Resources" with 🤝 emoji
- Dark mode support (uses CSS variables throughout)
- Larger fonts (1.1rem base, 1.3rem phone numbers) for accessibility
- High contrast links for readability

**Content categories:**
1. Transportation (LCT Dial-A-Ride, ViaLC, volunteer programs)
2. Health Services (UH Elyria/Oberlin, Medicare navigation, telehealth)
3. Food & Meals (Meals on Wheels, senior center meals, pantries, SNAP vouchers)
4. Community & Social (senior centers, library programs, AARP)
5. Financial & Home Assistance (HEAP/PIPP, home repair, legal aid, elder abuse hotline)

**Research approach:**
- Spawned 6 sub-agents in parallel (health, transport, food, community, financial, verification)
- All contacts verified as of Feb 2026
- Corrected outdated phone numbers:
  - LCOOA: 440-326-4800 (was 440-244-2222)
  - Second Harvest: 440-960-2265 (was 419-589-7948)

**Deployment:**
- Commit 30d78b0: Initial senior resources page
- Commit a89b55f: Dark mode fix
- Both pushed to GitHub: neilofneils404/graftonhub
- Live at: https://graftonhub.com/seniors

**Technical notes:**
- Static Astro site
- Manual Cloudflare Pages deploy via wrangler
- Local git + public GitHub (no internal notes pushed)
- Design philosophy: phone-first, practical, rural-focused

## Known Issues
- None currently

## Future Enhancements
- RSS feeds (Chronicle-Telegram, Cleveland.com) - pending correct URLs
- Real-time news data
- Pagefind search implementation
- Nancy's Diner easter eggs (404 page, console messages)

## Deployment Process
```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name graftonhub
```

## Git Workflow
- Local development on master branch
- Push to public GitHub when ready
