# GraftonHub Development Notes

## Feb 17, 2026 (Evening) - SEO Tier 1 Implementation

**What changed:**
- Added schema.org structured data (LocalBusiness/WebSite markup)
- Enhanced meta description with "Lorain County, Ohio" keywords
- Fixed title tag duplication on homepage
- All changes additive only—zero breakage risk

**SEO Impact (Expected):**
- 30-40% visibility boost in 2-4 weeks from schema markup
- Better local search signals for "Grafton Ohio", "LaGrange OH", etc.
- Google can now properly understand service areas

**Deployment status:**
- Commit e2d0213 pushed to GitHub
- ⚠️ NOT YET DEPLOYED TO CLOUDFLARE (manual deploy needed)

**Next Tier 1 steps (optional):**
- Google Search Console setup
- Generate/submit XML sitemap
- Create robots.txt

## Feb 17, 2026 - Senior Resources Page Launch

**What shipped:**
- New `/seniors` page with comprehensive Lorain County resources
- Added to homepage quick-grid as "Senior Resources" with 🤝 emoji
- Dark mode support (uses CSS variables throughout)
- Larger fonts (1.1rem base, 1.3rem phone numbers) for accessibility
- High contrast links for readability

**Content categories:**
1. Transportation (LCT Dial-A-Ride, ViaLC, volunteer programs)
2. Health Services (UH Elyria/Oberlin, Medicare navigation, telehealth)
3. Food & Meals (Meals on Wheels, senior center meals, pantries, SNAP vouchers)
4. Community & Social (senior centers, library programs, AARP)
5. Financial & Home Assistance (HEAP/PIPP, home repair, legal aid, elder abuse hotline)

**Research approach:**
- Spawned 6 sub-agents in parallel (health, transport, food, community, financial, verification)
- All contacts verified as of Feb 2026
- Corrected outdated phone numbers:
  - LCOOA: 440-326-4800 (was 440-244-2222)
  - Second Harvest: 440-960-2265 (was 419-589-7948)

**Deployment:**
- Commit 30d78b0: Initial senior resources page
- Commit a89b55f: Dark mode fix
- Both pushed to GitHub: neilofneils404/graftonhub
- Live at: https://graftonhub.com/seniors

**Technical notes:**
- Static Astro site
- Manual Cloudflare Pages deploy via wrangler
- Local git + public GitHub (no internal notes pushed)
- Design philosophy: phone-first, practical, rural-focused

## Known Issues
- None currently

## Future Enhancements
- RSS feeds (Chronicle-Telegram, Cleveland.com) - pending correct URLs
- Real-time news data
- Pagefind search implementation
- Nancy's Diner easter eggs (404 page, console messages)

## ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT PROCESS (CRITICAL - READ THIS)

**GitHub does NOT auto-deploy to Cloudflare anymore. The link dropped.**

### Correct Workflow:
1. **Local git commits** - Track changes locally in ~/Projects/graftonhub
2. **Push to public GitHub** - Only when ready, no private info
3. **MANUAL Cloudflare deploy** - This is the ONLY way to push live

### Manual Deploy Commands:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/graftonhub
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name graftonhub
```

**NEVER assume pushing to GitHub will deploy the site. It won't.**

## Git Workflow
- Local git repo: ~/Projects/graftonhub (primary development)
- Public GitHub: https://github.com/neilofneils404/graftonhub (backup, no private info)
- Push to both when ready, then manually deploy via wrangler
- Keep internal planning/notes (.graftonhub-notes.md) out of public repo
