## Validation Notes for Neil

**Items to double-check:**
1. Carlisle Township trustees - only confirmed Jared Smith, need other two names
2. Fire departments for Grafton Village and LaGrange Village
3. All phone numbers and emails (spot-check a few)
4. School principals - some extracted, some listed as "check staff directory"
5. Any locality-specific nuances you know from living in Carlisle Township

**Known good data (verified against official sites):**
- All five government websites as primary sources
- School district official sites (midviewk12.org, keystoneschools.org, oberlinschools.net)
- Utility providers (Columbia Gas confirmed for all)
- Major sports leagues (LCSL, Hot Stove, JR LC8)

**Cost of this research:**
- 15 Grok agents: ~$0.20-0.30 total
- Main orchestration (switched to Sonnet after initial Opus session): ~$0.50

**Next Steps:**
1. Neil reviews and validates
2. Update site pages with verified data
3. Create sports.astro page
4. Expand government.astro and schools.astro
5. Deploy to graftonhub.com
