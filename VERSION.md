## Version Numbering

- **Major** (1.x.x): Significant features or site overhaul
- **Minor** (x.1.x): New pages, major content additions
- **Patch** (x.x.1): Fixes, content updates, maintenance

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements (not scheduled):
- Search functionality (Pagefind)
- Business directory (high maintenance, deferred)
- Additional easter eggs for local landmarks
- RSS feed for events
- Print-friendly versions

**Philosophy**: Keep it simple, sustainable, and useful. Add features only when they clearly serve the community without adding maintenance burden.
